"""
Judge an exported STL the way a slicer and a printer would.

    python3 check_stl.py /tmp/sf-*.stl

Expects the naming written by verify_fins.js: `<case>.stl` (part + everything
added), `<case>-fins.stl` (fins only), `<case>-pad.stl` (pad only, if any).

Five things are checked, and each one exists because it caught a real bug:

  watertight/is_volume  a solid the slicer can union at all
  wall not in part      a fin fused to the part is not a breakaway fin
  tines fuse to part    a tine that misses is a divot with no grip
  tines touch the wall  tines were once 13.6mm from their own fin, which prints
                        as a scatter of loose specks (a broken patch frame)
  standoff              the gap should measure the spec's 0.2mm, not "roughly"

The pad is deliberately NOT held to the wall rule: it is meant to fuse.

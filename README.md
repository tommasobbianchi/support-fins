# Support Fins

**Tip a part on edge, and Support Fins adds the breakaway support fins that make that
orientation printable — baked right into the STL.**

Live at **[printfins.com](https://printfins.com)**. Runs entirely in your browser: nothing
uploads, nothing installs, no account.

## Why

Printing a part flat is usually the weakest way to print it. Lying or diagonal layer
orientation tests up to ~3× stronger than standing up. Most people print flat anyway,
because the strong orientation needs supports, and slicer supports scar the surface, waste
plastic, and take longer to pick off than the part took to design.

Designed-in fins fix that, and they beat slicer supports in one way a slicer can't touch:
the support lives in the STL. Upload it anywhere — any printer, any filament, any slicer —
and it still comes out right. A slicer only ever outputs gcode for one machine.

No slicer generates these. OrcaSlicer's whole style list is Grid / Snug / Organic / Tree
Slim / Strong / Hybrid, and none of them modify the mesh or bond to the part on purpose.
The technique isn't new (Slant3D has evangelized designed-in supports for years), but until
now you had to CAD it by hand every time.

## How it works

1. Import an STL, 3MF or STEP.
2. Rotate it. You're in control — Support Fins suggests, it never decides for you.
3. It shows you live: overhang count, how many can take a real fin, height, bed contact.
   Point at the load direction, answer one question — *does it pull apart, or does it
   lever?* — and it scores orientations for strength too.
4. Export. Fins and a bed pad come baked into the STL (or 3MF).

**Why you pick the rotation, not the software:** "stronger" means nothing without a load
direction, and the geometry doesn't contain one. Turn a solver fully loose and it'll hand
you a part 155 mm tall balanced on a needle with two sail-sized fins — technically optimal,
completely unprintable. (Ours did exactly that.) So the human makes the one call the
software can't, and the software does the rest.

## Status

The web app is live and does the full loop: load, rotate, score, fin, export. The geometry
engine is validated against third-party STLs and pinned by an offline test suite.

Working: overhang detection, bed-reachability, contoured breakaway fin walls, orientation +
load-direction scoring, the combined fin (wall + tines that fuse into the part — the whole
point; see `docs/FIN-SPEC.md`), optional sway braces that tie tall parts' sides on all
the way up (auto, or click an upright side in Draw), STL, 3MF and STEP import, STL and 3MF export.

Still open: scale-aware fin profiles, and the bed pad on tilted exports.

### Sway braces for tall parts

Tall, slender parts have a problem the fins were never built for: nothing overhangs, but
as the part grows, the nozzle's drag and each layer shrinking as it cools push the top
around. The part drifts, sags or wobbles, and every movement shows up as a layer line.
Sway braces stop that by tying the part's upright sides to a stiff support all the way up.

**What a sway brace is:** a vertical rib standing **edge-on** to an upright side (its stiff
direction). It's deep at the bed and tapers to a 4 mm flat top, gets thicker as it gets
taller, and sits on a thin foot on the plate. One-layer horizontal tines, spaced **evenly
up the full height**, tie it to the part. Like every support here, it stands off by the
breakaway gap and snaps off; only the tines touch the part.

**Using it:** tick **Sway braces (tall parts)** in the options panel. It's off by default.
- **Auto** braces the tallest sides for you: up to four faces facing different ways, so
  both axes are held, with each rib placed where its face reaches highest.
- **Draw**: one click on an upright side stands a brace there. Click a support you placed
  to select it (amber), then press **Delete** or **Remove selected**; Undo brings it back.
- Three settings appear while it's on: **Brace grip from** (height the tines start;
  0 = the whole height), **Brace tine spacing** (default 6 mm) and **Brace depth**
  (% of height at the bed; default 15%).
- Braces keep at least 1 mm of air between them. One that would run into another,
  for example straight across a narrow channel, is refused with a reason rather than
  fused into a bar that won't break away.

**Why this shape, not the old Brace fin:** the Brace fin lies flat against the face, so it
bends the easy way exactly when the part leans into it, and its tines bunch at the base
and spread out going up, leaving the top of a tall part, where the sway is, nearly
untied. Every number and the reasoning behind it is in `docs/FIN-SPEC.md` ("Sway
braces"); the code is `web/sway.js`, and `tests/sway.test.js` pins its behaviour.

**Status: printed.** Developed on a 249 mm fence-post cap, where Auto places 4 braces
(about 20 g of support) and hand-placed braces follow its gable up to 225 mm. Two test
prints (2026-09-22) both came out clean, so the defaults below — depth, thickness and
tine spacing — are the printed ones, not estimates.

### The "no config, geometry only" notice

Opening the 3MF, **Bambu Studio** ("invalid config, load geometry data only") and
**PrusaSlicer** ("does not contain PrusaSlicer configuration. Only geometry was
loaded.") show a notice and import just the mesh. This is **expected and harmless** —
every slicer shows it for any geometry-only 3MF (Fusion 360, FreeCAD, even the 3MF
Consortium's own reference files). The part imports correctly oriented and sized; the
fins come in as intended. Just slice with supports off. (OrcaSlicer opens it without a
notice.)

The export ships **pure geometry with no slicer profile embedded** on purpose: baking
in a profile would silence the notice but replace whoever-opens-it's printer/filament/
print settings with ours on load, and it would have to be re-authored per slicer *and*
per slicer version — a worse trade than a one-time, benign notice on a file whose
geometry is already right. See `web/threemf.js` for the writer.

## Run it locally

The web app is vanilla ES modules — no build step. Serve it with the included dev server
(it disables caching so edits actually show up on reload):

```bash
python3 dev-server.py                      # http://localhost:8731/
python3 dev-server.py 8080                 # custom port
python3 dev-server.py --host 0.0.0.0       # reach from other devices on the LAN
```

By default the server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). Pass `--host 0.0.0.0`
to expose it to the local network — handy on a headless box like a Raspberry Pi
behind a firewall; the script prints the LAN address to open. The port is an
optional positional argument and `--help` lists every option.

Or run the same `web/` directory in Docker — nginx on the host's 8731, so the URL
is identical to the dev server:

```bash
docker compose up --build        # http://localhost:8731/
```

There's no build step and no backend, so the image is just `nginx:stable-alpine`
serving static files with cache headers that match the dev server. See
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile), and
[`nginx.conf`](nginx.conf).

The Python prototype is the proof of concept the engine was ported from — plain mesh math,
no CAD kernel:

```bash
pip install trimesh numpy manifold3d
python3 prototype/spike_overhangs.py yourpart.stl      # what needs support
python3 prototype/spike_fins.py yourpart.stl out.stl   # add fins
python3 prototype/spike_orient.py yourpart.stl         # rank orientations
python3 prototype/spike_arrow.py yourpart.stl 0,0,-1   # load-direction scoring
```

Tests (Deno for the JS engine):

```bash
deno test --allow-read tests/
```

## The OrcaSlicer plugin

> **Credits.** Support Fins (the app, the fin engine, everything in `web/`) is by
> **Matthew Trahan**: [gittrahan/support-fins](https://github.com/gittrahan/support-fins),
> [printfins.com](https://printfins.com), [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/matthewtrahan). The
> designed-in support fin technique it automates is **[Slant 3D](https://www.slant3d.com)**'s.
> The OrcaSlicer port in `orca-plugin/` is by Tommaso Bianchi.

`orca-plugin/` runs Support Fins inside OrcaSlicer, on builds with the Python plugin system
(Plugins in the top-bar menu; OrcaSlicer nightlies). It uses the same fin engine as the web app,
unchanged.

Install it from **Orca Cloud** (Plugins, search "Support Fins", Subscribe), or from a checkout:

```bash
orca-plugin/install.sh                 # or: orca-plugin/install.sh <orca datadir>
```

Restart Orca, orient the part on the plate, then open the menu → **Plugins** → Support Fins → ▷.
The editor opens on the part as it sits on the plate, with the layer height (tine height), the
filament (PLA/PETG) and the bed size taken from your presets. **Send to OrcaSlicer** puts the
part with its fins and pad on the plate. The original stays there. Delete it before slicing.

How it works: Orca's plugin API can read meshes but not modify the model. So the plugin opens the
fin app in a **dock panel** beside the 3D view (no loopback server, no socket, no WebView2
dependency), and the two sides talk over Orca's message bridge. The page posts `{ready}` once its
listener is armed; the plugin replies with the session — the plate meshes (base64 STL) plus the
slicer settings the fins depend on. **Send to OrcaSlicer** sends the finned STL back over the same
bridge; the plugin saves it under `<datadir>/support_fins/` and loads it the way a second Orca
launch would: D-Bus `AnotherInstance` on Linux, `WM_COPYDATA` on Windows, `open -a` on macOS.
Only the Linux path has been run for real; the other two follow Orca's receiving code. Orca Cloud
gets one self-contained file, `dist/support_fins_any.py` from `python3 orca-plugin/build.py`
(web/ composed and embedded as a single page); every GitHub release publishes it
(`.github/workflows/publish-orcacloud.yml`). Test: `python3 orca-plugin/test_support_fins.py`.

## The PrusaSlicer plugin (hand-placed)

`plugins/prusa/` is a native PrusaSlicer 3.0 plugin, **Support Fins → Add a Fin**. The 3.0
plugin sandbox can't read a loaded mesh's triangles, so it can't do the automatic tool. It
drops one angled-print support fin instead: a thin triangle whose slope you set 0.2 mm under
a tilted part's underside, with one-layer tines along it (Slope Angle, Fin Height, Tine
Spacing). You place it by hand; size it with Fin Height rather than the slicer's scale tool,
which would stretch the one-layer tines. Confirmed working in PrusaSlicer 3.0 alpha11
(2026-10-02). For fins shaped to the part automatically, use the browser app. See `plugins/prusa/README.md`.

## Honest limitations

- Overhangs sitting over the *part* rather than the plate aren't handled — fins attach to
  the bed only.
- Features shorter than roughly a 4 mm wall height are too short for a real fin.
- It won't pick your orientation for you. On purpose.

## Layout

Fins are separate closed solids appended to the mesh; the slicer unions them. The whole
engine is plain mesh math with no boolean kernel, because it has to run in the browser.

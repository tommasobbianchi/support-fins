SPIKE / PROBE — does OrcaSlicer's plugin sandbox give us what printfins.com needs?

The website's whole trick is MESH ANALYSIS: read a model's triangles, find the
faces that overhang past 45 deg, and contour a breakaway fin to each one. Before
porting any of that (spike_overhangs.py + spike_fins.py, ~2k lines that lean on
trimesh) into an Orca plugin, this probe answers the two questions that decide
whether the port is even worth starting:

  1. GEOMETRY  Does `orca.host` actually hand back usable triangles for the model
               the user has loaded? The API is documented read-only -- `model()
               -> objects() -> volumes() -> mesh()` with `.vertices()`/`.triangles()`
               as numpy arrays -- but "documented" and "returns what we expect on a
               real STL/3MF the user dragged in" are different claims. This reads
               them and reports counts + bbox so we can eyeball it against the file.

  2. DEPS      The overhang math is pure-numpy-able; numpy is guaranteed present
               (Orca's own `ModelInstance.matrix()` needs it). trimesh is NOT
               guaranteed in the embedded interpreter, and the fuller fin steps
               (surface sampling, submesh, contact-line) currently use it. So the
               probe runs the OVERHANG CLASSIFICATION in pure numpy -- no trimesh --
               and separately just tries `import trimesh` to report whether the
               next phase can rely on it or must reimplement its handful of calls.

What the probe deliberately does NOT do: place anything on the plate. The Orca
host API is strictly read-only ("nothing here mutates the model") -- there is no
add-object / import-mesh / make-primitive call anywhere in the plugin surface.
That is the real ceiling and it is not a probe bug: fins can be COMPUTED here but
must be written to a .3mf and re-imported by the user. This probe stops at the
report so we can confirm the read + the math before building the export half.

Install (side-load): OrcaSlicer -> Plugins dialog -> Browse -> Install local
plugin -> pick this .py. Or drop it in `<data_dir>/orca_plugins/`. Then run it
from the Plugins dialog's Run action with a model loaded on the plate; the report
comes back in the result dialog.

Constants are copied from prototype/spike_overhangs.py CONSTANT-FOR-CONSTANT so
the in-Orca numbers match the website and the Python probes on the same file. If
one changes, change it in both places.

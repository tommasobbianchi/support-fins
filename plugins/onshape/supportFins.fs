/**
 * Support-Fins FS
 *
 * Adds designed-in breakaway supports to a part, so it prints support-free in
 * any slicer. A FeatureScript port of printfins.com
 * (github.com/gittrahan/support-fins, MIT), which automates Slant3D's combined
 * support fin (youtube.com/watch?v=vnn4XeKQobs).
 *
 * Three kinds of support are generated as separate parts that overlap the
 * original; export the part and its supports together as ONE STL and the slicer
 * unions them:
 *
 *   Overhang props   An upside-down-T rib under each overhang. The top follows
 *                    the underside a breakaway gap below it, necks to a thin
 *                    contact tip, and carries a comb of one-layer horizontal
 *                    tines that fuse into the part so it cannot peel or twist
 *                    off. Bend the rib and the tines snap clean.
 *   Stabilize fins   A round-topped wall standing a gap off a near-upright
 *                    face, on an elliptical base, gripping the face with rows
 *                    of tines -- for a part tipped onto an edge.
 *   Bed pad          A thin oval under a small bed contact, conforming to the
 *                    part and tacked to it, so a tilted part does not peel.
 *
 * Differences from the browser engine, all because Onshape has a real kernel:
 *   - The part is not reoriented. Pick the build plate (plane, face or mate
 *     connector) and the feature works in that frame.
 *   - The breakaway gap is certified by subtracting a copy of the part offset
 *     outward by the gap, instead of by point-sampling a triangle mesh.
 *   - Underside contours come from kernel raycasts against the B-rep.
 *
 * Why the tines are horizontal and one layer tall: a horizontal tine prints as
 * one continuous bead (nozzle runs along the wall, into the part, back out, no
 * retraction), which is what makes it both fuse and bend-snap clean. Set the
 * layer height to the slicer's, or each tine slices into two partial layers.

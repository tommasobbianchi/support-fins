# Support Fins — Onshape FeatureScript

A native **Onshape custom feature** that adds Support Fins' designed-in breakaway supports
to a part inside a Part Studio. It's a companion to [printfins.com](https://printfins.com):
same fins, same spec ([`docs/FIN-SPEC.md`](../../docs/FIN-SPEC.md)), but it runs on the CAD
model itself instead of an STL.

**Public Onshape document:**
[Fin Supports, V1](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/607917e8e297a68eb42cfb58/v/629a9559ea2972f32e386d1a/e/0875000cbc033d203bb4c861)
([latest workspace](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/607917e8e297a68eb42cfb58))

## What it does

Orient the part the way it will print, select it, and the feature adds the supports as new
parts beside it (the original part is never modified):

- **Overhang ribs.** Upside-down-T walls under each overhang. The rib top follows the
  underside a breakaway gap below it, necks to a 0.6 mm contact tip, and carries a comb of
  one-layer horizontal tines that fuse into the part. This is the web app's current default
  support.
- **Side bracing fins.** Round-topped walls standing a gap off a flat side of a part tipped
  onto an edge or corner, gripping it with rows of tines (ported from the old `fins.js`
  geometry, since removed from the web tool). Off by default. Auto picks up to N faces facing apart, or you select the faces.
- **Bed pad.** A thin oval under a part that touches the bed only along an edge or at a
  point, the same height as the rib flanges so the two merge flush.

Export the part together with its supports as **one STL** and slice with supports off, the
same as a printfins.com export.

## Why a FeatureScript

The web app has to work on triangle soup, so most of its engine is mesh plumbing: welding
vertices, rebuilding adjacency, inside/outside tests, hand-built watertight solids. Onshape has
a B-rep kernel, which removes most of that:

| printfins.com (mesh) | This feature (B-rep) |
|---|---|
| Reorient the part, re-seat it on the plate | Pick a build plate (plane, face or mate connector); nothing moves |
| Overhang test per triangle | Overhang test per face against the build direction |
| Contour the rib top by sampling the mesh (`contourTop`, `settleTop`, …) | Sample the underside with kernel raycasts, then **subtract a copy of the part grown by the gap**, so the gap holds everywhere, including the flanks |
| Point-in-mesh parity tests | `qContainsPoint`, `evDistance`, booleans |
| Emit closed triangle solids | Sketch + extrude real solids; the slicer unions them with the part |

It also covers issues [#24](https://github.com/gittrahan/support-fins/issues/24) and
[#25](https://github.com/gittrahan/support-fins/issues/25) (STEP support): anything Onshape
imports as a solid (STEP, Parasolid, native parts) works.

## Install

1. Open the public document above.
2. In any Part Studio: toolbar **Custom features** → **Add custom features** → find the
   **Fin Supports** document → add **Support-Fins FS**.
3. Onshape pins your Part Studios to that version. When a new version is published, Onshape
   offers the update.

To work on the code instead, make a copy of the document, or paste
[`supportFins.fs`](supportFins.fs) into a new Feature Studio. The icon is
[`supportFins-icon.svg`](supportFins-icon.svg): upload it to the document and point the
`icon::import(...)` line at it.

## Use

1. Orient the part for printing (for example with a **Transform** feature). The Top plane is
   the build plate unless you pick another.
2. **Support-Fins FS** → select the part.
3. **Print settings** → set **Layer height** to the slicer's layer height (each tine is one
   layer, snapped to the layer grid) and pick **PLA** or **PETG** (the `MATERIAL` profiles
   from `web/ui/settings.js`).
4. Optionally turn on **Side bracing fins** for a part balanced on an edge or corner.
5. Select the part and all its orange supports → **Export** → STL, as one file.

Every option has a hover tooltip. The full manual, with diagrams, the options, a
troubleshooting table for every message the feature reports, and printing tips, is
[`SupportFins_User_Guide.pdf`](SupportFins_User_Guide.pdf).

## Port notes

Geometry and constants follow the web engine and `FIN-SPEC.md`. Where this port differs:

- **Placement rules are a subset.** Ported: 45° overhang test with a small slack on the
  threshold, 12 mm² minimum region, ribs running down-slope (or along the long axis when
  flat), rows at the max-unsupported-span pitch, a single rib on the lowest line of a large
  curved band, squat walls with a brim, edge-biased tine spacing with a 3-tine grip floor,
  and the side fin's 60° / 12 mm site separation. **Not ported:** `splitRegion`
  sub-patching, `withLowTails`, part-attached ("floor") supports, sway braces, wall cutouts
  and orientation scoring. The feature never picks the orientation; that stays the user's
  call, as on the site.
- **The rib tip steps rather than tapers.** The tip is a 0.6 mm wall over the top 1.5 mm of
  a 1.0 mm stem, instead of `profileHalf`'s linear neck.
- **One base height.** Rib flanges, squat-wall brims and the pad share one height
  (PLA 0.6 mm, PETG 0.4 mm, rounded to whole layers), so they meet without a step. Side-fin
  bases stay at the spec's 1 mm.
- **Side fins are sized to the face outline.** The fin rises only as high as the face
  reaches across its whole length, so a tilted square face (a diamond) gets a fin in the
  middle rather than a plank beside a corner.
- **Supports are separate parts.** Nothing is booleaned into the user's part. The tines and
  pad overlap it slightly, exactly as the web export does, and the slicer unions them.

## Limits

- **Solid parts only.** STL and other meshes import into Onshape as mesh bodies, which the
  feature can't process. For STLs, use printfins.com.
- Overhangs over another part of the model rather than over the plate get no rib, the same
  as the web app. Use **Add overhang faces** to force one.
- Side fins need a flat face at least 4 × 4 mm, leaning no more than the Max face lean
  (default 45°) from vertical, with open space beside it.
- Very complex parts with large curved overhangs can take a few seconds to regenerate.

## Status

Runs in Onshape (FeatureScript 2931) on test parts, including a tilted cube and a complex
part with curved overhangs. **Not yet print-tested:** the geometry follows `FIN-SPEC.md`,
but nothing generated by this feature has been sliced and printed yet. Reports from real
prints are welcome.

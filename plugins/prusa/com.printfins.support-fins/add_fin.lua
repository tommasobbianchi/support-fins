-- Support Fins -- Add a Fin.
--
-- Drops ONE breakaway support fin into the scene for a part printed TILTED: a
-- thin right triangle that stands under the part's sloped underside, the same
-- shape as the 30/45/60 deg angled-print fins people already place by hand
-- (printables.com/model/1771718). Its SLOPE runs from a low tip on the plate up
-- to the top of a straight back edge, a gap under the part, on a thin foot. Along the slope runs a comb of TINES: one-layer horizontal nubs that
-- reach across the gap into the part, so each prints as a single strand that
-- fuses in and snaps clean when you bend the fin off (docs/FIN-SPEC.md).
--
-- You position it by hand with PrusaSlicer's move tool -- the plugin sandbox
-- can't read your model or place on its surface (that's what printfins.com
-- automates). Set Slope Angle to the underside's angle, turn the fin (about Z
-- only) so its slope climbs the same way, and slide it until the slope sits
-- GAP (0.2 mm) under the part -- e.g. the low tip GAP/sin(angle) out from
-- where the underside meets the plate.
--
-- Frame: thin in Y (thickness). The low tip is at x = 0 on the plate; the
-- slope climbs toward +X at the chosen angle to height H, then a short flat
-- (never a point) runs to the vertical back edge. The tines point -X, down the
-- slope, horizontally into the part above it.
--
-- The smooth slope is ONE cube turned to the angle (a rail whose top face IS
-- the slope); a stack of cube steps fills under it, every step corner inside
-- the rail, one layer tall below where the rail starts so the slope is never
-- notched deeper than the slicer's own layer steps. The API's only triangle (make_prism) is isosceles with its apex
-- centred and would need a Negative cut that the slicer draws as a grey box.
--
-- All geometry is built in ONE flat object space via shapes.builder(): every
-- piece is placed in the SAME frame as the first step, and the builder anchors
-- the whole object to it on emit.

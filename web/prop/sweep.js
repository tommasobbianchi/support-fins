 * edge. The wall tapers to the `tip` width at BOTH ends: the top tip breaks away
 * under the overhang (the part bridges the `gap`), and the bottom tip is the only
 * thing that welds to the part below, kept as narrow as the top so it leaves the
 * smallest possible witness mark and snaps off cleanly.
 *
 * The bottom stops PROP.footGap above the floor -- the same clearance as the top,
 * a slicer's "bottom Z distance". It used to weld on purpose, on the worry that
 * a gap at both ends makes a floating island the slicer can't anchor; the foot
 * coupon (prototype/calibration/foot/) printed the gap clean, and the welded tip
 * was the only one that scarred the part (local issue 009). The first layer
 * sags across the gap, so the bottom keeps the full wall thickness -- two lines
 * over air, not one 0.6 mm tip line that could peel. footGap 0 welds as before.

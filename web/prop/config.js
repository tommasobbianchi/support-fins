  // own 7.0 never hit this because a human places ONE wall per feature, never a
  // packed row. A long wall also gets ample bed grip from its LENGTH, so the foot
  // is only an anti-wobble brace, not the adhesion; 3.0 braces a tall thin wall

  // regions no wall or wedge reached) one down to minSpanShort is kept when its
  // height is at most maxShortAspect x its length (4.4 mm long x 22 mm tall passes;

  // than that gets NOTHING from the wall path -- its stations are trimmed as
  // stub/blocked and the low ledge prints into air (the near-bed overhangs that
  // came out rough on real organic parts). Below minHeight but above this floor a
  // brimmed squat breakaway is built instead (see sweepSquat): a thin wall on a
  // thin wide brim -- the full T-foot can't fit, but the wall still needs plate
  // grip. Below minHeightSquat the overhang sits ~on the bed and the first few

  // couple layers tall so it still snaps off clean, and because it sits on the

  // 9 clean / ZERO bad walls / 13%. Denser stations both contour the top more
  // finely and probe the flanks more often, and the coverage it costs is lost
  // to the straightness gate rejecting curved regions -- which is M6b's problem
  // to solve by splitting them, not this one's to solve by shipping a support

  // --- TINES (the grip comb) ---------------------------------------------
  // A plain prop stops `gap` under the overhang and the part bridges over it:
  // a pure breakaway, no grip. The COMBINED support adds a comb of tiny
  // horizontal nubs along the wall's top that reach the part's surface, so a
  // tilted part cannot peel or twist off the wall -- and, because each nub is
  // one layer line lying in the layer plane, it BENDS to snap clean instead of
  // tearing out (fins.js documents the same reasoning for the beside-the-face
  // fin these replace). Tines only bite where the overhang is steep enough that
  // a horizontal poke reaches solid: past a slope of gap/reach the nub lands in
  // the part, below it in air, and the emitter simply skips the ones that miss
  // (verified by insidePart, never assumed) -- the same honest behaviour the
  // beside-the-face fin had.
  // A tine must be exactly ONE layer tall: printed that way it lays down as a
  // single continuous bead (the nozzle runs along the wall, into the part, back
  // out -- no retraction), which is the whole reason it fuses AND snaps off clean
  // (FIN-SPEC.md "Why the tines must be horizontal"). One layer means one SLICER
  // layer, so this has to equal the print's layer height -- 0.3 (Slant3D's number,
  // his layer height) baked in a 1.5-layer tine at Matthew's 0.2mm.

  // fault, not the tines'. Surface marking from the dense comb is now tamed the
  // deliberate way: the user's "Tine grip" slider (tineStepFor / opts.tineDensity),

  // where anti-peel/twist grip has the longest moment arm anyway) and THINS across

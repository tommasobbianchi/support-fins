 * `topLine`, the HIGHEST part surface strictly below the overhang, or 0 (the
 * plate) where nothing intervenes.
 *
 * This is the exact mirror of `contourTop`. contourTop looks UP across the tip
 * and takes the LOWEST hit, so the tip stops `gap` under the overhang; floorLine
 * looks DOWN across the bottom and takes the HIGHEST hit below the overhang, so the
 * support lands on the part instead of driving to z=0. Taking the highest hit
 * across the bottom's width (not just the centre) means the bottom rests ON the
 * floor and never digs into it -- the same reasoning contourTop uses to keep the
 * top out of the part.
 *
 * `margin` keeps the overhang's OWN face from being read as its floor: only
 * surfaces at least `margin` below the contact line count. Stations with no
 * intervening surface fall through to 0, so a wall that is part over-part and
 * part over-bed degrades station-by-station to the plate with nothing special-
 * cased -- the current all-to-plate behaviour is just the everywhere-0 case.

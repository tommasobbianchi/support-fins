/**
 * A small tube against the patch path, for one region.
 *
 * A SMALL tube (under tubeMinArea, see tubeLine) is a new claim on a region the
 * patch path used to own. It does WORSE on some regions the patch path served
 * (bore_bracket flat: 98 -> 52%, its weld check rejects the only wall;
 * voron_drive_frame x45y30: 36 -> 32%, one band's patches held two long walls
 * where its tube line sat off to one side), and better on others (drive frame
 * x60: 22 -> 34%). So the tube is built first, taken back out, the region's
 * split patches are built from the same starting point, and whichever holds more
 * overhang area stays. A tie keeps the patches.
 *
 * buildProps drives it from its patch loop:
 *
 *   const mark = rivalry.begin(patch);        // top of every patch
 *   ...build the patch's walls...
 *   if (patch.smallTube) rivalry.tubeDone(patch, mark, patches);
 *   rivalry.finish();                         // after the loop
 *
 * `acc` is everything the loop accumulates -- { out, props, skipped, served,
 * tally: { tines, sagRisk } } -- so a route can be snapshotted and undone.

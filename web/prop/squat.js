/**
 * Build brimmed squat breakaway walls on the sub-minHeight bed stations of a
 * contoured overhang line -- the near-bed overhangs a full T-wall can't reach.
 *
 * A flanged wall needs ~minHeight of headroom to exist at all, so `sweep` and its
 * trim discard every station lower than that; on an organic part whose underside
 * ramps down to the plate, that abandons the whole low band and it prints into
 * air. Here the low band is built directly: the stations with minHeightSquat <=
 * height < minHeight (DISJOINT from the tall run the caller builds, so the two
 * never compete) are walked into maximal runs, and each is swept via `sweepSquat`
 * -- a thin wall on a thin WIDE brim. The full T-foot can't fit under a 1mm wall
 * (footMin 1.6 would splay into a sheet), but the wall still has to HOLD to the
 * plate, so the brim gives it the adhesion area a bare 0.6mm-wide tip never could.
 * Same weld guard as the plate path: a squat wall that would fuse is dropped,
 * never shipped ("no prop" is fixable, a fused prop is a ruined print).
 *
 * Operates on a private deep copy of the line so `settleTop` never mutates the
 * points the caller's tall path still reads. Appends triangles to `out` and
 * returns the placed prop descriptors (marked `squat: true`).
 *
 * `claimed` (optional, per station) marks stations a tall wall already covers
 * with its low TAIL (withLowTails); those are skipped so the two never stack.
 * Only stations the built wall really spans are claimed -- a low band next to a
 * BLOCKED tall station still gets its squat wall.

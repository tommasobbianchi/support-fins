/**
 * Raster placement: walls across a region's WHOLE footprint, the way a slicer's
 * grid support stands, raced against the patch/tube placement region by region.
 *
 * Why. A wall's top already follows whatever surface is above it (contourTop,
 * settleTop), so a wall does not need a straight or flat overhang -- only a
 * straight track in PLAN. What held curved parts back was placement: a curved
 * region got ONE wall under its lowest line (tubeLine), and anything else was
 * split into 15-degree patches (splitRegion) with every patch under 12 mm2
 * dropped. The dome ceiling example got 2 walls and 34% of its area held with no
 * skips at all -- nothing refused, the placer simply never tried a second wall.
 * Laying parallel tracks at the row pitch across the whole region, the way a
 * grid support does, took it to 75% (bowl 24 -> 75, torus X30 4 -> 54, the real
 * bear upright 0 -> 57; spike in prototype/raster/, local issue 008).
 *
 * Why a race and not a replacement. Raster alone LOSES on real tubes: a pipe on
 * its side wants one wall under its lowest line, and parallel tracks across it
 * land on its flanks (hook 98 -> 36%, vase_flare X30 93 -> 59%). So buildProps
 * builds the normal pass, then a raster pass over only the regions the normal
 * pass left partly bare (`rasterWanted`), and `raceRegions` keeps, per region,
 * whichever holds more overhang area -- by a margin, so a region the normal pass
 * already holds does not swap one clean wall for several stepped pieces for a
 * sliver more area (the real gree figure's arm, measured in the spike).
 *
 * Split out of prop.js, which only wires the two passes together.

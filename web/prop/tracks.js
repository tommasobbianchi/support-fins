 * Split one overhang region into locally-straight sub-patches.

 * A connected overhang region is a topological artifact, not a support unit:
 * union-find in overhangs.js merges the entire tilted underside of
 * voron_drive_frame into one 3,240 mm2 region whose contact line sits 6.4 mm RMS
 * off any straight axis, so the straightness gate -- correctly -- refuses to
 * sweep a wall along it, and the region's genuinely straight ledges are refused
 * with it. The unit a wall wants is the locally-flat piece.
 *
 * Split the FACES, never the polyline: `contactLine` fits ONE principal axis to
 * whatever it is given, so for an L-shaped or wrapped region the polyline is
 * already wrong before any split could rescue it.
 *
 * Region-grow from a seed face, judging every candidate against the SEED's
 * normal, never its neighbour's. planes.js documents why pairwise agreement is
 * wrong: it creeps -- a cylinder's faces each differ from the next by a few
 * degrees, so the whole cylinder merges into one "flat" patch. Growing against
 * the seed cannot creep, because the hundredth face is judged by the same
 * reference as the first. The cutoff is tighter than planes.js's 35 degrees
 * because the jobs differ: a wall patch only has to keep facing the fin, while a
 * sub-patch here has to yield a contact line straight enough for `straightness`
 * (0.10 RMS/chord) -- a band of underside curving more than ~15 degrees each way
 * already bows past that.
 *
 * Seeds are taken largest-face-first, so the flattest expanse defines each
 * patch's reference normal and slivers join a patch instead of founding one.

 * The single lowest-line wall for a CURVED region -- the tube case, and the

 *
 * `breakaway.py` was written for the shelter hubs: round tubes fanning off a
 * ball core, each propped by ONE web that follows `tube_underside()` -- the
 * tube's true lowest generatrix. Those parts printed. The port lost that
 * behaviour when splitRegion arrived: a tube's underside band curves, so the
 * 15-degree grow cut shatters it into facet strips, and each strip then gets
 * its own track along its own axis -- six short walls fanned across a tube
 * that wants one long one (rendered and looked at, hub_corner at 25 degrees:
 * a star of crossing walls under the ball).
 *
 * The routing question is CURVATURE, not width. A cylinder's underside band
 * is ~1.4R wide -- wider than maxUnsupportedSpan on every hub -- but one wall
 * under its lowest line is still the right support, because the band curves
 * UP away from that line: each shell of the tube rests on the shell below it
 * once the bottom generatrix is held. A flat plane has no such self-support,
 * which is why it gets rows. So: normals fanning from their mean = curved =
 * one wall on the lowest line; normals agreeing = flat = rows via
 * splitRegion/patchTracks.
 *
 * A BOWL also fans, in every direction at once -- its lowest points form a
 * ring, and `straightness` refuses the ring here, exactly as it always has.
 * The caller then falls through to the splitRegion path, whose track holes
 * refuse it a second way. Returns null when this region is not a tube.

/**
 * The contact polylines for one locally-flat sub-patch: straight parallel
 * tracks sampled on the patch's own surface, spaced maxUnsupportedSpan apart,
 * split wherever the patch does not cover them.
 *
 * This replaces per-bucket lowest-point selection (`contactLine`) for
 * sub-patches, because on the patches splitRegion produces, that selection is
 * unsound three different ways -- all measured on the dev matrix:
 *
 *   - On a WIDE tilted plane the lowest point per slice alternates between the
 *     downhill edge and pocket rims 26mm away; the polyline zigzags (34 reversals
 *     on voron_drive_frame @25) yet PASSES the RMS/chord gate, because 6mm of
 *     wobble is small against a 115mm chord. The sweep then self-intersects:
 *     134 bodies, one with negative volume.
 *   - On a FLAT ledge every point ties for lowest, so the pick is arbitrary and
 *     the "line" reads 0.103 -- voron_filter_housing @0's one servable ledge,
 *     refused on tie-breaking noise.
 *   - On a COARSE mesh a 169mm2 patch can be a single triangle: four points
 *     cannot be bucketed into a track at all.
 *
 * Tracks run along the patch's principal HORIZONTAL axis -- the same axis
 * contactLine fits, and the direction the owner's sketch draws: on a frame
 * whose underside slopes along its length, the principal axis IS the slope, and
 * the wall's top climbs with it. (A first version ran tracks along the mean
 * normal's level contour instead, which sounds right and is wrong the same way
 * planes.js's 15-degree vertical cut was: on that frame the level contour is
 * the SHORT direction, and the flagship 96mm wall came out 15.7mm.)
 *
 * One track per maxUnsupportedSpan of width, centred so the outermost sit half
 * a spacing inside the edges: a patch narrower than one span gets exactly one
 * wall down its middle, a wide plane gets a row of parallel buttresses. Each
 * track is straight in XY by construction, so the sweep's sections are parallel
 * and cannot collide.
 *
 * Where the patch does not cover a station -- a pocket, the hole in the middle
 * of a bowl's ring, the notch of an L -- the track SPLITS, and each piece stands
 * on its own against minStations/minSpan. That is what keeps refusing the bowl:
 * its ring only ever covers short chords of a straight line, and short chords
 * are stubs. The hole is load-bearing; never bridge across a null.
 *
 * `axis` ([ux, uy]) overrides the run direction. A lattice strut passes its own
 * long axis (prop/lattice.js): a strut running AROUND a dome slopes across its
 * 4 mm width, so down-slope runs across it and every track is a stub, while the
 * same strut running down the dome got a wall -- identical struts, different
 * support. A lone strut's long axis is clean; the drift below is a messy
 * region's.

 * lip of up to half a pitch past the last row; on a FREE edge (air past it, see
 * freeEdge) that lip is a cantilever, and on the slenderness coupon a 4 mm one
 * curled on every ledge. So the outermost row MOVES OUT to a free edge, flush
 * (PROP.edgeInset), and the rows spread evenly between the two ends: the same
 * number of walls. #143 added a row there instead and kept the old ones, which
 * doubled every free edge (lowledge 3 -> 5 walls, a cube at X20-30 3 -> 5, two
 * walls ~6 mm apart); Matthew 2026-10-01: same count, the end ones flush.
 * With no free edge, no part to probe, or a steep underside (`probe` null; see
 * PROP.edgeFlatDeg), the old layout exactly.

/**
 * PROP mode -- a breakaway wall that stands UNDER an overhang.
 *
 * This is a different support from the fin in fins.js, not a variant of it, and
 * the difference is what it leans on:
 *
 *   Stabilize  a wall BESIDE the part, gripping a face with horizontal tines.
 *              Needs a face to grip, so it cannot serve a cone or a sphere.
 *   Prop       a wall UNDER the overhang, rising from the plate and stopping
 *              `gap` short. The part bridges that last layer, so the wall never
 *              fuses and it snaps off. Needs only an underside contact line,
 *              which every shape has.
 *
 * A prop has no tines, deliberately. Tine-less supports were rejected early in
 * this project on Slant3D's demo of a cube falling away from one -- but that is
 * a part balanced on an EDGE with the support as its only restraint. A part
 * sitting down on the plate with an overhang above it has no such failure mode:
 * gravity holds it onto the prop. `tools/support/breakaway.py` in the video repo
 * works exactly this way, has no tines anywhere in it, and produced good fins on
 * real printed shelter hubs -- the parts Stabilize could not touch.
 *
 * The geometry is M3's, which was validated (34/36 regions served, every wall
 * watertight) and then retired for the wrong reason. What is new here is the
 * judgement around it: a prop is only emitted where the wall can actually reach
 * the plate through open air.
 *
 * LAYOUT. This file is the entry point: `buildProps` (the auto-placer's whole
 * pass over a part), `noProps`, `coverRowSpan`, and re-exports of everything
 * fins.js, draw.js, ui/ and the tests import. The pieces live in web/prop/:
 *
 *   config.js     PROP, every number a wall is built from
 *   surface.js    seat a vertex; part surface height(s) above (x, y)
 *   contact.js    the contact line under an overhang, settled to exactly `gap`
 *   sweep.js      the wall solid: the upside-down T, and a part-attached wall
 *   clearance.js  which stations can carry a wall (reach, certification, runs)
 *   tines.js      the grip comb along a wall's top
 *   tracks.js     where Suggest puts walls: straight patches, tracks, tube line
 *   mold.js       the floor under a wall on the part, and its bottom's shape
 *   attached.js   walls that stand on the part instead of the plate
 *   squat.js      brimmed squat walls for the near-bed band
 *   rival.js      a small tube against the patch path: the region keeps the better
 *   raster.js     walls across a region's whole footprint, raced against the rest
 *   lattice.js    a net of struts cut back into struts (the raster slot's contender for a net)
 *
 * Each module imports only modules above it in this list and never prop.js.

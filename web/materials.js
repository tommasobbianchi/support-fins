// Material profiles: the clearances each filament needs, one table for the website
// (ui/settings.js) and the plugins' engine entry (plugins/shared/engine/fins_entry.js),
// so a plugin's PETG prints the site's PETG numbers.
//
// PETG welds to a support far harder than the PLA every bite
// number here was tuned on, so PETG needs more clearance in both places at
// once: the plain breakaway prop's clearance (PROP.gap), and the bed pad -- thinner (FIN.padH) with a gap
// instead of a tack (PAD.grab < 0). PLA is exactly today's numbers, so switching
// to PLA (or never touching this) leaves existing prints unchanged. density is g/cm^3
// for the grams receipt.

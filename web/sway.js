/**
 * SWAY BRACES -- buttress ribs that keep a TALL part from drifting, sagging and
 * wobbling as it grows.
 *
 * The rest of the engine answers "what holds this overhang up?" A tall, slender
 * part has a different problem: nothing overhangs, but the higher it gets the
 * more the nozzle's drag and each layer's shrink as it cools push the top around.
 * The part flexes, and every flex is a visible layer line. The cure is the one a
 * builder uses on a tall wall: a buttress standing out from the side, tied to it
 * at intervals all the way up.
 *
 * So a sway brace is:
 *   1. the RIB, a vertical plate standing PERPENDICULAR to an upright face (edge-on
 *      to it, which is its stiff direction -- a plate lying flat against the face,
 *      the old Brace, bends the easy way exactly when the part leans into it). Its
 *      inner edge follows the face at the breakaway gap, and it TAPERS: deep at the
 *      bed, narrow at the top, so it stays stiffer than the part it holds;
 *   2. the FOOT, a thin flange on the plate so the rib stays down;
 *   3. the TINES, one-layer horizontal bridges from the rib's inner edge into the
 *      part, spaced EVENLY up the whole height. The Brace spaced its tines densely
 *      at the base and spread them 1.6x per row, which suits a part that might tip
 *      over early but leaves the top of a tall part, where the sway is, nearly
 *      untied. Here the spacing stays even, and the user can start the grip higher.
 *
 * Same rules as everything else here (docs/FIN-SPEC.md): the rib never leans, the
 * tines are horizontal and exactly one layer tall, the geometry is plain closed
 * solids unioned by the slicer, and a rib that can't be built says why.
 *
 * The gap arrives in `opts` rather than being read from FIN/PROP, so this
 * module depends on neither: the caller passes the material's numbers, whether it
 * runs in the Worker (after fins.js applyTunables) or on the page (Draw).

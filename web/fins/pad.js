  // layers) and tacks 0.05mm into the part, so the slicer merges pad + part into
  // ONE region on the first layers and runs solid infill straight across the
  // contact -- a weld. A slicer brim comes off easily for three reasons, and this
  // copies them: it is ONE layer (only the first layer grips the bed, so more
  // layers add stiffness and weld height, never adhesion); it stands a small gap
  // off the part's first-layer outline, so the slicer keeps two regions and runs
  // perimeters PARALLEL to the part (bead beside bead, not infill through); and
  // first-layer squish closes that gap just enough to hold. A tilted part's
  // flank still prints its second layer onto the pad's inner edge, but only a
  // strip ~layer/tan(tilt) wide, since the pad is only one layer tall.

/**
 * A breakaway pad under the part's bed contact.
 *
 * Not a nicety: a part tilted into a strong orientation rests on an EDGE, so its
 * bed contact is near zero and it peels off before the fins have anything to
 * hold. The pad is a wide, thin footprint -- thin enough to cut off, wide enough
 * to stick.
 *
 * It is fed the part's lowest VERTICES for its outline (a part standing on an
 * edge has no face on the plate at all, so a face-based footprint is empty in
 * precisely the case the pad exists for) AND the seated part triangles, so its
 * TOP can hold `gap` clear of the part instead of welding to it.
 *
 * THE SHAPE: the first pad was a flat 0.5mm slab, so wherever the part's underside
 * dipped into that band -- which is exactly the resting contact the pad exists for
 * -- the two fused solid (measured 0.46mm of interpenetration on a tilted
 * drive_frame) and would not break off. The pad conforms to the part instead, and
 * (Matthew's ask) it is a clean OVAL rather than a boxy grid: a radial mesh of the
 * contact ellipse -- rings of vertices from the centre out to (r1, r2) -- with each
 * vertex given its own top height. OUTBOARD (no part overhead) rises to the full
 * `padH` for the wide bed grip; under the part it caps at `part_low + grab`, a light
 * tack that connects without the deep weld. The disc is one watertight solid (top
 * cap + flat bottom + side wall), so there are no cells to drop and no holes.

 * the part's underside the way PAD.grab does for the 'sure' pad; 'light' uses 0.
 *
 * The gap has to come through the SLICER, which merges any slice gap under
 * ~0.098mm, so it is held exactly on the first layer: the part's first-layer
 * outline is its section at that layer's mid-height (what the slicer prints),
 * and the pad's top there ramps LINEARLY with the true distance from that
 * outline, crossing mid-height exactly at `g`. A linear ramp survives the mesh's
 * linear interpolation; the earlier min-of-underside field stepped at vertical
 * faces and let the sliced edge drift to 0.036mm off a cube's end face. The pad
 * is also held below the lowest underside within `g` (plus `grab`), which keeps
 * it clear of the part on any layer above the first (Custom thickness).
 *
 * The mesh is columns across the oval's long axis, each running rim to rim with
 * the same number of rows, at `brimCell` spacing, so the outline stays the
 * smooth oval. The two tips close with a fan; the bottom is one flat fan (the

/**
 * Wall sites: the flat, near-upright patches of the part that a fin can stand
 * against.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. M3 swept a wall along the contact line *under* an
 * overhang, and that geometry can never take a horizontal tine: a wall passes
 * under the contact line or rises above it, never both, because at the contact
 * height the part touches the wall's plane and the wall would have to pinch to
 * zero thickness right there (prototype/probe_tines{,2}.py). So the fin stands
 * BESIDE the part instead, off an upright face, and the tines carry the load --
 * which is what "combined support" means and why docs/FIN-SPEC.md says to place
 * fins on an edge or corner.
 *
 * That turns fin placement into a search for flat upright faces, and a flat face
 * is something the topology already knows exactly. No raycasting is needed here,
 * and therefore no BVH: the probes fired compass rays because they were hunting
 * for a face at an unknown bearing, but working from the mesh's own faces gives
 * the plane directly, to float precision rather than to whatever the ray ladder
 * happened to sample.
 *
 * THE FIN LEANS WITH THE PART. A first version of this file required faces to be
 * within 15 degrees of vertical, which sounds obviously right and is obviously
 * wrong: tilting a part into a strong orientation is exactly what stops its
 * faces being vertical. On a Voron frame at 30 degrees it found ONE usable
 * patch out of 35,520 faces. The fin has to be parallel to the face it serves --
 * so it leans by the same angle, which prints fine, because a thin wall leaning
 * by up to MAX_LEAN_DEG is a self-supporting overhang. Everything here is
 * therefore expressed in the patch's own frame, not the world's.
 *
 * The payoff shows up in the tines. Because a patch is certified flat to
 * FLAT_TOL, the distance from the fin wall to the part is the standoff
 * EVERYWHERE on it -- so a tine is a fixed-size nub, not a measured bridge, and
 * it needs no per-tine ray to size it.
 */

/**

 *
 * Wide on purpose. At 12 degrees this was the binding constraint on any round
 * part: a 32-sided cone steps 11.25 degrees per facet, so a patch could never
 * grow past its immediate neighbour no matter what the distance budget allowed.
 * The distance band below is the real guard -- every face is measured against
 * the SEED's plane, so nothing can creep -- and this only has to keep the patch
 * on surfaces still facing the fin, since a face turned edge-on would be skimmed
 * by a tine rather than bitten.

/**
 * How far the real surface may stray from the patch's fitted plane, in mm.
 *
 * The budget is ASYMMETRIC, because the two directions fail completely
 * differently and a single number has to be the smaller of them:
 *
 *   - TOWARD the fin, the wall is what gets hurt. Anything bulging past the
 *     standoff puts the wall inside the part; at 0.5mm this was measured 1.7mm
 *     deep in a Voron housing. The budget must stay under the standoff, and
 *     under the obstruction test's own threshold, or a patch blocks its own wall.
 *   - AWAY from the fin, nothing is hurt except tine length. The surface simply
 *     recedes and the tine reaches further, which is free until the tine stops
 *     being a tine: prototype/probe_tines2.py put that limit at 1.5mm of
 *     unsupported span, beyond which it is a bridge.
 *
 * Treating them as one number is what limited fins to flat-faced parts. A round
 * part's facets are 1-2mm tall, so a symmetric tolerance grips exactly one facet
 * -- on hub_post_foot at 70 degrees the best grip available anywhere on the part
 * was 0.86mm. Letting the surface recede lets one flat wall span many facets.

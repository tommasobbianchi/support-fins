/**
 * Combined support -- the entry point the app, the Worker and the plugins call.
 * `buildFins` builds the tined breakaway walls (prop.js) under the overhangs,
 * adds angled wedges under the broad downward faces no wall reached, lays a bed
 * pad under a part that barely touches the plate, and runs sway braces last.
 * docs/FIN-SPEC.md is where every number comes from.
 *
 * The tines are the point. A wall with only a gap constrains the part in one
 * direction and it falls away sideways -- Slant3D demos a cube doing exactly
 * that mid-print. Tines are what make it a *combined* support.
 *
 * WHY THE TINES ARE HORIZONTAL: a horizontal tine prints as one continuous layer
 * line -- the nozzle runs along the wall, crosses into the part and back out,
 * with no retraction, laying a single strong bead. A vertical tine is its own
 * little tower grown a dot per layer: frail, often never touching the part, and
 * a retraction each. Horizontal tines also lie in the plane of the layer lines,
 * which is what lets you BEND them to snap clean instead of tearing them out.
 *
 * LAYOUT. This file is the entry point: `buildFins`, `buildFinsCore` (auto and
 * prop), `applyTunables`, `coverPitch`, and re-exports of everything app.js,
 * orient.js, finworker.js, ui/, the plugins and the tests import. The pieces
 * live in web/fins/:
 *
 *   config.js     FIN, the tine, pad and coverage numbers the UI shares
 *   seating.js    how the part sits on the plate: contact, face/edge/point
 *   pad.js        PAD and the bed pad (conforming oval, or the brim-style one)
 *   wedges.js     angled wedges where no wall reaches; gripPatches for Draw
 *   shortwalls.js the last resort: short, stocky walls where nothing else reached
 *
 * Each module imports only modules above it in this list and never fins.js.

 * finworker.js, a module Worker with its OWN instance of fins.js and prop.js: module
 * state does not cross a Worker boundary, so everything the page set stayed on the
 * page. PETG picked in Auto mode therefore printed PLA's clearances -- silently, since
 * the numbers on screen were right and only the geometry disagreed.
 *
 * So the values travel WITH the build request (opts.tunables, structured-cloned like
 * every other option) and are applied here, in whichever instance is doing the work.
 * Unknown or non-finite entries are ignored, and calling this with nothing leaves the
 * defaults alone -- an old caller that doesn't pass tunables behaves exactly as before.

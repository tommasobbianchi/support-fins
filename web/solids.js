/**
 * Bridge a run of cross-sections into one closed solid and push its triangles.
 * Each section is a ring of `k` vertices in the same order; consecutive rings
 * are joined with quads and the two ends are fan-capped. Caps assume the
 * section is convex, which both sections below are (a rectangle, and a
 * rectangle with a tapered top).
 *
 * Wound OUTWARD. Inherited from M3, where this emitted every triangle backwards:
 * the shell was closed and consistent -- euler 2, no boundary edges -- but its
 * volume came out NEGATIVE, so every normal faced into the solid. M3's own check
 * only asked whether the mesh was watertight, which it was, so this survived
 * being called validated. A slicer would read it as a hole rather than a wall.

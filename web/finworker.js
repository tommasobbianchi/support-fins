// buildFins -- and everything it imports (prop.js + web/prop/, inside.js, planes.js,
// overhangs.js) -- is pure mesh math with no DOM or three.js dependency; that is
// exactly why prototype/verify_fins.js can run it headless. So the whole build
// moves into a Worker. On a large or badly-posed part a single build can take a
// couple of seconds, and running it inline froze the entire page (orbit,
// buttons, sliders) until it finished. Here the main thread posts the topology +
// analysis + pose + options, we build, and post the triangles back; the page
// stays live the whole time.
//
// `analyze` deliberately stays on the main thread: it is ~1-2ms even on a big
// part and its result is shared with draw/orient/export, so duplicating it here
// would only add a place for the two to drift.
